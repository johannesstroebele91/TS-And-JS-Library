# Problem:
* Client → Request
* Server → Answers the request by presenting an updated page

# Solution:
* JS/TS allows to run logic in the browser
* therefore it can manipulate what users see

This is done by manipulating the HTML structure (DOM) of a page
* So it is possible to change what the users sees
* without fetching a new HTML page
