// RELEVANCE
/* JS enables execute operations simultaneously
* in order to do something with the time
* e.g. a HTTP request, ... needs for executions

The concepts include Callback functions,
 * Promises and the use of Async, and Await
 * to handle delayed operations in JavaScript

Most of the time
* async/await is the best solution (least complex)
* followed by promises
* followed by callbacks (most complex)*/
